Dangers of Influenza:

- A potentially virulent and distinct strain of the swine-flu virus that continues to kill and panic people appears to have taken hold in India
- it may have acquired mutations that make it more severe and infectious than previously circulating H1N1 strains
- As on March 2015, swine flu had claimed 1,482 lives across India and infected 26,000. As the graph below shows, this is easily India’s most devastating H1N1 pandemic in recent years
- In addition to the mutations responsible for increasing human receptor binding and virulence, other factors, such as the high population density in India, ease of person-to-person transmission, potential for inter-species transmission and lack of sophisticated farming practices could potentially aid the circulation of this virus

Sugested measures:

- it calls for greater Indian scientific attention to tracking and releasing genetic information about the current flu pandemic
- continuous monitoring and timely reporting of outbreaks, sequencing of viruses in human and animals, particularly subtypes that are known to infect or spread in humans, and rapid dissemination of whole viral genome sequences in public databases

leprosy patients
-incidents has been reducing but largest number of leprosy patients in 2014.
-no environment sympathy for these patients in the country, both in society
 and in the administrative structure
-discriminatory law like prohibiting from standing in election
- Motor Vehicle Act of 1939 which restricts leprosy patients from obtaining
 a driving license
- Indian Rail Act of 1990 which prohibits leprosy patients from traveling by train.
-formulated before the Multi Drug Therapy came into being, and they have not
 been updated since
-accepted reaosn for divorce some law still consider it non curable ignoring
 latest medical development which make is complete curable.
- Lepers act-1948 enforces complete segregation of leprosy patients.
sol
-National Leprosy Education Programme of 1985, should be given more funds

Law commission 256 report ending discrimination against leprosy
-(1) The need to repeal provisions of laws including personal laws which discriminate on grounds of leprosy.
(2) Stop the official use of the word leper.
(3) Amendment of the Persons with Disabilities Act to broaden the definition of ‘disability’ to include all categories of person affected by leprosy.
(4) Enactment of a legislation that promotes the inclusion of persons affected by leprosy and their family members through affirmative action. Such a legislation should provide for measures against discrimination, land rights over leprosy colonies, right to employment and educational opportunities. 
Above will be in line with UNGA resolution to eliminate descrimination against leprosy patients 2010 and UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2007

The UNMDGs 4,5,6,7 have a subset of 10 Health Indicators of which only 3 have been MET by India,as per a recently released WHO Report.They are
(1)Reduction in HIV incidence
(2)Reduction in mortality rate for TB
(3)Increase in access to safe drinking water

India has made SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS wrt 
(4)Reduction in under 5 mortality rate and (5) reduction in MMR
while made LIMITED or NO PROGRESS in
(6)Measles immunisation
(7)Family Planning
(8)Antenatal care coverage
(9)Increase in access to improved sanitation,and
(10)Births attended by skilled health personnel.

The poor performance can be attributed to:
1.Lack of quality and accountability in sterilisation surgeries
2.Staff vacancies and non availability of Health personnel
3.Low Budgetary allocation to health sector
4.Lack of awareness among public about sanitation
5.Prevalence of open defecation
6.High levels of pollution
7.Insufficient access to PHCs and logistical difficulties in rural and tribal areas
8.Lack of demand and confidence in vaccines among public
9.Inefficient reporting and management

India can improve her performance by :
1.Increasing CatchUp Campaigns for measles immunisation 
2.Helping weaker states to emulate good performers
3.Increasing health expenditure 
4.Empowering women against discriminatory social norms
5.Filling up existing vacancies of health personnels
6.Improving the base of ASHA workers
7.Strengthening private sector and civil society participation
8.Adopting transparent and effective management practices
9.Improving confidence in safer and less invasive male sterilisation
10.Integrating sanitation, waste management and energy generation
using new technologies as under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

Middle East respiratory syndrome
-Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus or MERS-CoV is a pathogen which belongs to the same family as the SARS Virus . 
-originated in Saudi Arabia, where its first case was detected in 2012.
However, subsequent analysis showed two previous cases in Jordan.

While complete clarity is not there are the host of the virus, it is believed to be transmitted by camels. as it was found in 75% of the samples of camel milk. And the disease has spiked during spring when the female camels wean their young. 
-The disease has also been mostly contracted by camel herders and people who may have consumed unpasturised camel milk. Thus, strengthening this conclusion.
-On the other hand, the virus has also been found in Bats, suggesting that it might be the host.
-The WHO has been viewing the problem seriously. However, it has not yet declared a global public health emergency. While the virus has been detected in 1200 people and killed more than 440, most of them have been in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
-The virus is also most dangerous to people having underlying health problems or pregnant ladies. The virus also does not transmit very easily amongst humans. Most of the victims have either been health care workers or family members in close contact with infected people.
-People dies because of illness of vital organ like kidney failure and often pneumonia.
-threats that, such communicable disease may spread because of mass influx of people in Mecca(Saudi Arabia) for holy pilgrimage
- first time the disease is exported to non-Middle east nations like South Korea and China because non-compliance of restricting the affected person from travelling abroad
Thus, rather than issue travel advisories which could increase anxiety, the WHO has just reiterated that health care workers should take extra precautions while handling such cases to ensure that there is no accidental transmission and the endemic is ended.


National health profile 2015
-By  Central Bureau for Health Intelligence (CBHI)

The recently released National Health Profile 2015 has made reported some grim facts and predictions relating to healthcare in India:
-Extreme shortage of hospitals both in public and private sector. Each public  hospital serves approximately 61000 patients.Every government allopathic doctor serves a population of over 11,000 people
-even shortage of essential medicines
(A) Poor patient to bed ratio and poor doctor to patient ratio - there is only one bed for over 1800 people and only one doctor caring for 11,000 people in Indian government hospitals. These numbers are evidence of poor infrastructure and reflect lack of preparedness of the healthcare machinery to tackle frequent outbreaks as is evidenced by the recent dengue and swine flu outbreak 
(B) The government's expenditure on healthcare continues to dwindle and India spends less than 1% of its GDP on the health sector .
(C) Healthcare expenditure account for a large portion of household expenditure on account of rising cost of medicines and hospitalisation. This will result in the perpetuation of poverty, which will feed to the growing cost of healthcare, thus forming a vicious circle
(D) Increase in the incidence of non-communicable diseases(esp  cardiovascular diseases) - this creates a new challenge for India's healthcare regime, which is often preoccupied firefighting infectious diseases. A worrying prediction is an increase in the incidence of cancer in the coming years.
(E) While there has been a decrease in the death due to incidence of communicable disease(like Malaria,ChickenGunai,Dengue), the incidence of pulmonary TB remains one of the highest in the world.

Against this background, reform of the healthcare sector becomes imminent. Any further delay is bound to adversely affect India's chances of leveraging its demographic dividend for sustained and inclusive economic growth. The quick passage of the draft National Health Bill, which besides addressing many of the above mentioned concerns also seeks to make the right to health justiciable would be a step in the right direction.

Differentiate between severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and severe chronic malnutrition (SCM). Discuss the types of malnutrition Indian children face, reasons why they persist and interventions needed to eliminate them

SAM is typical of African countries and is a medical emergency where children are not only hungry but are also sick
with high levels of mortality. It is because of drought, civil wars, crop failure etc. Hence both medical care and quality feeding is required.

SCM is typical of India where children are only hungry but not sick therefore it is not a medical emergency. It is because of poor feeding practices, chronic food insecurity, poverty and protracted illness. Thus it is less severe than SAM but is continual form of malnutrition.

Indian children face SCM due to which 30% of under 5 years of age are underweight, 1 in 5 is wasted and 2 in every 5 is stunted. Also Indian children are prone to micronutrient deficiency where 60% pre schoolers suffer from deficiency of vitamin A. These are higher than poorest of African country due which south asian enigma is termed as Indian enigma.

Reasons:
1. Poverty
2. Illiteracy and ignorance about nutrition and government schemes
3. Improper implementation of TPDS
4. Non empowered mothers 
5. Lack of health facilities(doctors, nurses, medicines etc)
6. Denial of reproductive rights to women
7. Early marriage of girls as child born at young age is severely malnourished
8. Lack of sanitation and drinking water facilities which causes gastrointestinal problems due to which nutrients do not get absorbed in body
9. Junk food eaten by children which are low in nutrients causing micronutrient deficiency
10. Poor breastfeeding habits

Tackling malnutrition:
1. To tackle micronutrient deficiency food fortification or bio fortification of good option. These food grains should be distributed via TPDS, MDMS, ICDS etc.
2. Hiring more staff to be placed at PHC, CHC and district hospital
3. Weekly iron and folic acid supplementation, JSSK, NSSK should be effectively implemented to ensure than pregnant women should not give birth to malnourished child and for providing post natal care
4. Expenditure on health should be increased from current 1% to atleast 6% of GDP
5. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, National Nutrition Mission, National rural drinking water Programme be implemented in letter and spirit
6. Education of mothers on nutrition be aggressively pursued with help of ASHAs, ANMs, Anganwadi workers
7. Promoting healthy eating habits in children. Banning selling of junk food around school premises.
8. Countering poverty via providing more days of employment under MGNREGA in drought areas
9. Providing reproductive rights to women and discouraging early marriage.
-.Strict implementation of de-worming initiative of the govt. as worms are rampant among children.
2.Cheap nutritious food like ragi(more calcium than milk),groundnut etc. should be popularised

What India today need is holistic approach then only we can be able to garner fruits of demographic dividend and our
younger generation is able to contribute towards economic growth.

Recent Dengue outbreak (or in general epidemic spread.)

-Very young child Avinash died of dengue after 5 hospital refuse him to admit.After his death his parents also committed suicide :(

The refusal by medical facilities to admit critically ill patients is also a behavioural issue, not supported by guidelines and protocol
-1989, through the case of Parmanand Katara Vs the Union of India , the Supreme Court passed a landmark judgment that no medical facility can refuse or turn away any critically ill or emergency patient, on any grounds.
-stated that such refusal would be viewed as a violation of the right to health, enshrined within Article 21 of the Constitution that guarantees the right to life and liberty.
-Every doctor, whether at a government hospital or otherwise, has the professional obligation to extend his services with due expertise for protecting life

-> Why health infra is in shoddy state ?
-Corruption ,Lack of transparency and accountability of health administrator
-lack of infra owing to less spending by Govt as %age of GDP
-Moreover major focus of Government remains on curative health rather than preventive health
-Medical infra in majority is driven by private hospital ,most of which are profit oriented
-Behaviour issue by hospital like not admitting  critically  ill patent
-Very less %age of doctor per thousand of population. country is short of 9 lack doctors.
-As world bank data shown less number of hospital beds per 1000 of people compared to world average.

->why does India experience repeated outbreak of epidemics ,even after spending more
-People behaviour like recent outbreak of Dengue in Delhi , it can be avoied easily if people take care of their surronding.
-Loss of immunity owing to extensive use of anti boitic, govt is even planning to make a policy on that so the antibiotic use is minimized and taken only when really required
-lack of universal vaccination cover. Govt has launched Mission indardhanus to take care of that.(? is it related to epidemic)
-Lack of awareness about sanitation habbit in many people which can avoid spead of any communicable disease
-lack of infra in most of hospitals to segrregate patient to avoid contact with other.
-lack of potable drinking water access.


Way forward:-
1)Government needs to utilize the proposed increased budget efficiently with infusing transparency and fixing accountability .also spending should be increased gradually to 5% as per UN standards
2)Focusing on preventive care by increasing the awareness among the people.Swatch Bharat Abhiyaan will also come handy here with major focus on construction of toilets and inducing hygiene in the society.
3)Regulation of private hospitals like having a cap on medicines,test etc.Although medicines are covered now by NPPA also but its ambit needs to increased further on tests and other procedures 
4)Use of Alternative medicines like AYUSH to plug the inadequate health infrastructure
5)Lastly preparedness of governments like taking advance steps during monsoon to tackle diseases like malaria,dengue,Japanese encephalitis will certainly curb on the spread of epidemic diseases.

Reforms needed
-how a first-point-of-contact institution, whether private or public, a small clinic or a large hospital, responds need to be improved.
- Sri Lanka is considered almost malaria-free (even after 3 decade of war) due to effort by  communities, human resources and various other aspects of a public infrastructure.
-inefficiency of civic bodies should be done away with.
-Although the Consumer Protection Act is applicable to health services, and there is now the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act of 2010, the need to access emergency health care is always of such urgency


Measure to fight Tobacco menace
-Present Measures Adopted
~ Increasing pictorial warning to 65% of areas from present 40%
~COTPA Cigarette and other Tobacco Products act, 2003 also bans the smoking in public places 
~Differential taxes on basis on length of Cigarettes
~ Ban of sale of gutka, jarda in States Punjab etc 
~Awareness campaign through print ,electronic media
Issues in present approach
~ Pictorial 65% is inadequate when compared to parliamentary committee suggestion of
 90% and previous decision for 85% [ 60 image + 25 text]
~ Taxes imposed have become more a revenue to state rather discouragement
~ Ineffective ban , even minors have access to Purchase of tobacco products
~Use of Scorpene in advertisement , which should be Crab instead symbolising cancer
~Textual warning are redundant as lower literacy .
~ Ineffective ban on Films and Shows which glamorise such addictions 
~ Inadequate alternate sources for tobacco cultivators 
~ Schemes of minor forest produce Tendupatta and no Attention towards Bidis which 
are as harmful 

Sustainable development goals
-17 goal adopted gy GN in sept 2015,aim to wipe out poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate change over the next 15 years 
-by 2030 - we will eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, foster inclusive economic growth and combat climate change 



-


->simillarity
-focus area for both almost same , in fact SDG stars from stage built by MDG.
-Eradicating the poverty remain main focus for both
-


->Diff
-MDG has 8 goals with 21 measurable target , SDG has 17 goal aind 169 target , so monitoring the progress may loss focus and most central area may be missed
-Unlike the MDGs, the SDGs are not a largely aid-driven agenda. nation has to mobilize their own resources like taxing , private investment , CSR etc
-While the MDGs applied to all countries, in reality, they were perceived as targets for poor countries to achieve, with funding from wealthy states. SDG is more universl and cover wider issues.
-One thing the SDGs make explicit is the promise to "leave no one behind." This is a big change from the MDGs, where averages were measured and very often the most vulnerable including women, rural or marginalized populations were not reached. 

All eyes are on India SDG is to India what MDG was to china as would would have failed the target has china not pulled many people outside poverty.
